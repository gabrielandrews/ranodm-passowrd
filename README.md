## Password-Generator
# Description
This project is to produce a password generator that gives the user an option of using uppercase, lowercase, letters, numbers and special characters to provide them with a random password within the minimum of 8 and the maximum of 128 characters.

# This goal was achieved by following these steps:
•Generating a prompt to ask how many characters you would like your password to be.
• Generating multiple confirm prompts to ask which characters you would like to include and not include into your password.
• Creating if statements to tell the code what to do if the user wanted or did not want certain characters.
• Created a for loop to pass through the "true" arguments using the mathfloor and mathrandom functions to multiply times the password length to provide the generated password.
